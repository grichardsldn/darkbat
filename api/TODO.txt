Ad the moment if I have two Shapes with the same ref, then
becasue that ref gets used in the Model in the player and items
are remoed before they are re-added to the Model, the net result 
is that the first shape with a given ref gets replaced by one that
follows it. - Not sure what that means.

Have been able to signal a click back to a click receiver.

Next to write a Vol class which presents a volume control and
allows clicks to move that volumen control.
